This is a variation of John Conway's Game of Life, but it's implemented in C and has some limitations.

How to play:

While paused, click to place live cubes.
Press Enter to start.
Press Backspace to pause.


Warning: I implemented it using a 'for' loop, so printing the cubes in pause mode is very slow. 
Also, the window size is 1000x1000 pixels, you can make it larger, but the playable window remains 1000x1000.
